WESLEY has joined Picard on the bridge.

WESLEY  
How do they cloak the planet?

DATA  
The theory is simple. The shield
bends light rays around the
planet's contour -- similar to the
Romulan cloaking device -- but the
implementation is very difficult.

A BEAM OF ENERGY PENETRATES the bridge at that moment.
It searches until it finds Wesley, then SURROUNDS him.
He can't move away from it. He closes his eyes and
relaxes into it.

PICARD  
Wesley!

GEORDI  
Sir, the energy beam is
originating from Aldea.

PICARD  
Shields up. La Forge, contact
Commander Riker. Worf, check
all other decks.
