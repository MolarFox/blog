WESLEY is running down the corridor after someone.

WESLEY  
Hey, Jake! Wait a second!

JAKE KURLAND, eighteen, dark-haired and intense, stops
and waits for Wesley.
```hello
WESLEY  
(continuing)
How're you doing?
```
JAKE  
(tries to smile)
I'm fine. Really.

WESLEY  
I'm real sorry...

BEVERLY'S COM VOICE
Acting Ensign Crusher, report to
Deck Twenty-one Forward Lounge.

Wesley ignores the request.

JAKE  
It's not your fault.

WESLEY  
Yes, I know, but I wish we were
both going.

JAKE  
(shrugging)
Only thirty-two points...

BEVERLY'S COM VOICE  
Acting Ensign Crusher, respond.  

Wesley touches a com panel.

WESLEY  
I'm on my way.

Wesley looks at Jake.

WESLEY  
(continuing)  
Gotta go.  

They shake hands.
