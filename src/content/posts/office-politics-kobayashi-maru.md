## A Kobayashi Maru?
A no-win situation - a test! In the Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan, we see Starfleet cadets undergo this test - commanding a simulated ship towards inevitable, crushing defeat in an unwinnable scenario.

Although the outcome will always be crushing defeat, the test aims to assess _how_ cadets handle such a situation. Do they make decisions well? Do they handle the situation with grace? Do they minimise their losses, despite the unfavourable outcome?

Today's scenario falls firmly into this category, and we'll focus on identifying and responding to it through this lens.

## Key Skills
<!-- 
- always be kind. Employ empathy. Look to apply benefit of doubt
    - And observe how employing it leads to the truth of the matter 
- Always assess your tactical options
    - + show how often they will lead to bad places
-->


# Setting the Scene
<!-- 
- the org
- the team
- the "damian"
- the manager 
    - good vibes only -> people first, to the extreme
-->

# The Clock Strikes Twelve
<!-- 
- the document
    - goes to everyone higher up first
    - targeted - knows what keywords will incite leadership response
    - ties into values for no reason?
    - has one singular line where "good engineer" is mentioned


- responding
    - the mistake of treating it liek normal feedback
        - eg: talking to more people for more opinions = negative response
        - emotional response
        - my learning: always thank, be discerning about when to 
-->

# Signs of Trouble
<!-- 
- 1 on 1 tensions w/ damian
- things dissolve when the EM is there
- I go on a trip
    - trip coincidentally happens when some big session happens
    - used as further political leverage 
- The defensiveness of Damian
    - Eg: pulling out old feedback to say "not sudden, I was always saying this"
    - In what world is that kind of defensiveness useful?
    - Signs of political attack, not genuine feedback
-->

# Favoured Current
<!--
- EM becomes frustrated (behind closed doors)
- Sides more with Damian
    - the document said "good engineer". It's fair feedback no?
- No opportunity to fight back now - no support from EM
- EM will not investigate situation further. Set in stone
- Eg: PR reviews, Damian claiming my work for theirs
- No amount of support from elsewhere will help
    - Despite support from all over org
    - Any consultation would fix issue. A second opinon from 
- EM still pushing for promo, but seemingly pushes harder for "feedback doc" 
-->

# Porcelain Shards
- 

# Walking Out With the Laundry
<!-- 
- concepts of cult
    - The way you need to be positive, no room for negativity
    - negativity is shut down immediately
    - Allude to "good vibes only" article draft concepts
- peacefully leave team, actually rough and painful
- feeling gaslit into seeming like you're the problem
    - spending a long time before being able to process and shake this feeling. 
    - eg: natural response if staff and EM give you feedback, tell you you're at fault, is to believe you're at fault
    - help with analysing the situation. understanding it -->


# A Record, Scrubbed
<!-- 
- Watching achievements be erased
    - why the EM does this -> playing the game. decided I am bad touch
-  
-->


# Damage Control
 

# Epilogue
<!-- 
- Damian leaves
    - gambling online casino
- who knows where I'll end up
    - staff offers. could leave anytime
        - eg: make sure the control remains with you 
-->

# Summary
 <!--
 - thank rexy, friends
    - mention

# References
