## A Kobayashi Maru?
A no-win situation - a test! In the Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan, we see Starfleet cadets undergo this test - commanding a simulated ship towards inevitable, crushing defeat in an unwinnable scenario.

Although the outcome will always be crushing defeat, the test aims to assess _how_ cadets handle such a situation. Do they make decisions well? Do they handle the situation with grace? Do they minimise their losses, despite the unfavourable outcome?

Today's scenario falls firmly into this category, and we'll focus on identifying and responding to it through this lens.

## Important Tools
<!-- 
- always be kind. Employ empathy. Look to apply benefit of doubt
    - And observe how employing it leads to the truth of the matter 
- Always assess your tactical options
    - + show how often they will lead to bad places
- More on skills rec
    - Eg: psychology of needs
    - Eg: nonviolent communcation
- Radical Candor
-->
The scenario we'll be exploring today is involves a people-problem in an engineering team. In it, a politically-savvy staff engineer with a personal animus is able to deftly convince the entirety of our organisation's leadership team to thoroughly discredit an engineer on their team.

Unfortunately today, by "an engineer on their team", I mean me.

As with pretty much every "people problems" scenario, there's a great deal of subtle and often unspoken - communications in body language, subtle changes in people's behaviours, furtive exchanges of words in office corridors, etc. 

To avoid writing a whole novella on this scenario, our goal will be to analyse the most important bits only, with a laser focus on only the things we can learn from, and/or which help us analyse each situation and the motivations behind each person involved in them!

Here are some key principles, mindsets, and descriptive handles we'll make full use of as we go into our analysis below:

### Psychology of Needs

### The Ladder of Interference

# Setting the Scene
## The Org


## The Team

## The "Damian"

## The Engineering Manager

<!-- 
- the org
- the team
- the "damian"
- the manager 
    - good vibes only -> people first, to the extreme
-->

# The Clock Strikes Twelve
<!-- 
- the document
    - goes to everyone higher up first
    - targeted - knows what keywords will incite leadership response
    - ties into values for no reason?
    - has one singular line where "good engineer" is mentioned


- responding
    - the mistake of treating it liek normal feedback
        - eg: talking to more people for more opinions = negative response
        - emotional response
        - my learning: always thank, be discerning about when to 
-->

# Signs of Trouble
<!-- 
- 1 on 1 tensions w/ damian
- things dissolve when the EM is there
- I go on a trip
    - trip coincidentally happens when some big session happens
    - used as further political leverage 
- The defensiveness of Damian
    - Eg: pulling out old feedback to say "not sudden, I was always saying this"
    - In what world is that kind of defensiveness useful?
    - Signs of political attack, not genuine feedback
-->

# Unbalanced Scales
<!--
- EM becomes frustrated (behind closed doors)
- Sides more with Damian
    - the document said "good engineer". It's fair feedback no?
- No opportunity to fight back now - no support from EM
    - Plus, how to raise? Nobody asked. No opportunity to rebutt convos in the background
    - Very one-sided convo as a result
- EM will not investigate situation further. Set in stone
- Eg: PR reviews, Damian claiming my work for theirs
- No amount of support from elsewhere will help
    - Despite support from all over org
    - Any consultation would fix issue. A second opinon from 
- EM still pushing for promo, but seemingly pushes harder for "feedback doc" 
    - Could see they were frustrated, but with me
        - Knew the way EM expressed themselves. Never directly. Very sugar coated
        - Eg: <refer to those notes from premortem exercise>
-->

# Porcelain Shards
<!-- 
- "Damian" loses it
- Unkind words used
    - Analyse them anyway
    - EM decides that after this chat, the issue is resolved??? Things hsould be better somehow???
- Burnout
    - How EM saw this as avoidance?? That "Damian" was doing a great job doing work, and I wasn't
    - Touch on how empathy doesn't work here. How as an EM can you see a situation like this and not want to speak to all parties, figure out what's actually happening, if a resolution came about?
        - Instead assuming things are fine and using more scapegoating
        - Perhaps this was with the influence of "Damian"
- Damian uses my work and gets credit for it
    - EM was very impressed with all the great work Damian was doing. How they were pushing on with the work
    - Yet it was all my work, from my plans... at best, Damian had it explained to them and gave some input on it
    - EM is frustrated with me now
        - Seen EG: where EM is reviewing PRs etc
- By this point my stamina was worn out
    - Dealing with all the pressure, anxiety alone
    - I hadn't given up. But it was fundamentally difficult to continue here
- Look after yourself
    - When you are alone especially. You need 
-->

# Walking Out With the Laundry
<!-- 
- New team
    - One I was thinking of heading to anyway, for a new challenge
    - EM I already knew, understood, and trusted
- concepts of cult
    - The way you need to be positive, no room for negativity
    - negativity is shut down immediately
    - Allude to "good vibes only" article draft concepts
- peacefully leave team, actually rough and painful
- feeling gaslit into seeming like you're the problem
    - spending a long time before being able to process and shake this feeling. 
    - eg: natural response if staff and EM give you feedback, tell you you're at fault, is to believe you're at fault
    - help with analysing the situation. understanding it 
- 
-->


# A Record, Scrubbed
<!-- 
- Watching achievements be erased
    - why the EM does this -> playing the game. decided I am bad touch
-  Rest of team did ask some Qs. But did not want to press the matter
    - I didn't blow up the issue either. Reassured team things were fine, I was moving onto a new challenge
    - Cult mindset. Don't rock the boat
-->


# Damage Control
<!--  
- Learning about everything that had happened in the background
- Realising the extent of the damage
- Shaking off the cult mindset / gaslighting
-->
 

# Epilogue
<!-- 
- Damian leaves
    - gambling online casino
- who knows where I'll end up
    - staff offers. could leave anytime
        - eg: make sure the control remains with you 
-->

# Wrapping Up
 <!--
 - thank rexy, friends
    - mention help w/ neurospicy stuff
-->
## Summary

## Thanks
I want to thank my friends for lending me their experience and advice, and for pulling me to come step outside and live life whilst I was in the thick of things. I especially want to thank my good mate Rex for all the 3am minecraft sessions talking through this stuff, and Gx and Tim for the quality advice on the neurospicy-perspective.

A big shoutout goes to an old friend and then-fellow-EM who mentored me whilst I was finding my feet as a fresh engineering manager many years ago, whose career means he's not allowed to get a named shoutout. It's anonymity for you, bucko! This is the third or fourth rewrite of this blog post I've made in 6 months, and his recommendations on "Radical Candor" and "The Ladder of Interference" have given handles to concepts I was otherwise having trouble expressly concisely.

And hey, not to be cheesy, thank you for reading!

Have you faced a situation like this yourself? Are there things I didn't touch on, or you think I should've done differently? Are there other tools and resources you can recommend for dealing with situations of this category?

I would love to hear your thoughts down below.
