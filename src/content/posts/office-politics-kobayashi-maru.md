## A Kobayashi Maru?
A no-win situation - a test! In the Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan, we see Starfleet cadets undergo this test - commanding a simulated ship towards inevitable, crushing defeat in an unwinnable scenario.

Although the outcome will always be crushing defeat, the test aims to assess _how_ cadets handle such a situation. Do they make decisions well? Do they handle the situation with grace? Do they minimise their losses, despite the unfavourable outcome?

Today's scenario falls firmly into this category, and we'll focus on identifying and responding to it through this lens.

## Important Tools
<!-- 
- always be kind. Employ empathy. Look to apply benefit of doubt
    - And observe how employing it leads to the truth of the matter 
- Always assess your tactical options
    - + show how often they will lead to bad places
- More on skills rec
    - Eg: psychology of needs
    - Eg: nonviolent communcation
- Radical Candor
-->
The scenario we'll be exploring today is involves a people-problem in an engineering team. In it, a politically-savvy staff engineer with a personal animus is able to deftly convince the entirety of our organisation's leadership team to thoroughly discredit an engineer on their team.

Unfortunately today, by "an engineer on their team", I mean me.

As with pretty much every "people problems" scenario, there's a great deal of subtle and often unspoken - communications in body language, subtle changes in people's behaviours, furtive exchanges of words in office corridors, etc. 

To avoid writing a whole novella on this scenario, our goal will be to analyse the most important bits only, with a laser focus on only the things we can learn from, and/or use to further our analyses.

Here are some key principles, mindsets, and descriptive handles we'll make full use of as we go into our analysis below:

### Radical Candor
From a great book I was recommended, by Kim Scott. 

The main concept is a 2d graph defining 4 types of communication across the two axes of "caring personally" and "challenging directly". 

This isn't a simplified MBTI / personality categorisation - it would be correct to say that every individual will likely communicate in one of the 4 ways, varying from situation to situation. Also, unlike a personality categorisation where there is no "ideal" category, the ideal quadrant to be communicating in is the 'Radical Candor' quadrant.

Delivery of feedback is the most common (but not only) use-case in which this framework is employed.

[TODO: image here]

| Quadrant                      | Summary   |
| :------------:                | :------------: |
|   Radical Candor              |   Kind, clear, specific and sincere communication. <br> This is the ideal communication type.   |
|   Obnoxious Aggression        |   Also called brutal honesty or front stabbing. <br> This happens when you challenge someone directly, but don’t show you care about them personally.   |
|   Manipulative Insincerity    |   Backstabbing, political or passive-aggressive behavior — is what happens when you neither Care Personally nor Challenge Directly. <br> It’s praise that is insincere, flattery to a person’s face and harsh criticism behind their back.   |
|   Ruinous Empathy             |   This happens when you want to spare someone’s short-term feelings, so you don’t tell them something they need to know.<br> It’s praise that isn’t specific enough to help the person understand what was good, or criticism that is sugar-coated and unclear.  |

The book itself is well worth a read if leadership and communication are of interest to you. 

We'll see that two of the actors in our scenario will tend to communicate mostly in a couple of these communication categories. We'll use this categorisation in combination with their motivations to help us contextualise how their intentions are communicated.

#### Chess
Oh yes! Throughout this post, you'll see little references to chess terms or comparisons to chess situations. You don't need to know anything about Chess to read this article, and you can ignore those bits without losing any of the detail.

The intended takeaway from those references is to remember to 


# Setting the Scene
Alright! With those in mind, let's dim the lights and set the scene.

## The Org
This scenario takes place in an engineering-led organisation with an excellent culture. In most ways, a dream for an engineer to work at. There is strong senior leadership, good team sizing, and a generally open culture. 

## The Team
A modestly sized engineering team. 


## Me
In this scenario, I'm an IC on the team, and a well established software engineer. 

I accepted a voluntary demotion in rank from senior coming into the company, and was looking to climb back up with an internal promotion after a year at the org. 

At the point we'll begin below, we're about a month away from an upcoming promotion cycle, and I had everything lined up to make it happen. A big document full of initiatives I'd started, projects I'd led, people I'd mentored, etc. Alongside that I had made plenty of cross-team collaboration happen, and had plenty of good references in various engineering teams if I needed them. Asking around for feedback from EMs I'd had contact with by then, there was nothing but positive feedback. I was a "shoe-in" was the phrasing used.

Each of those bits of information will become important. For now, the main detail we'll use for our analysis is the fact that I'm seeking promotion and have taken all the steps to ensure I'm all set for the upcoming round.

## The "Damian"
A staff software engineer on our team, and the most senior IC. Generally someone that is well regarded in the organisation, and in the team. One would struggle to find anything negative to say about Damian at the time. 

Damian's communication style is on the "does not challenge directly" side of the Radical Candor compass, generally avoiding rocking the boat and preferring to maintain a positive persona. We will observe that their adeptness at impacting political change from a distance later on, and observe that they intentionally communicate in the "Manipulative Insincerity" quadrant of our Radical Candor compass, to great effect.

## The Engineering Manager
Since we'll mostly just be referring to the same EM throughout our analyses, we'll just refer to them as "the EM" and disambiguate as necessary.

The EM likes to be people-first in their approach to leadership. In good times, this means a focus on good times (team lunches and activities), and on rituals that appear to promote feedback-giving and public recognition.

In challenging situations however, a notable phenomena is that the EM will have difficulty in dealing with bad news - often preferring to imply, infer, and hint at things they aim to communicate, generally communicating within the "Ruinious Candor" quadrant of the compass in such situations. The EM will take a hardline approach to minimising and quelling team conflicts, thought we'll expore the "good-vibes only" nature of how this specifically occurs more below.

# The Clock Strikes Twelve
<!-- 
- the document
    - goes to everyone higher up first
    - targeted - knows what keywords will incite leadership response
    - ties into values for no reason?
    - has one singular line where "good engineer" is mentioned


- responding
    - the mistake of treating it liek normal feedback
        - eg: talking to more people for more opinions = negative response
        - emotional response
        - my learning: always thank, be discerning about when to 
-->


# Signs of Trouble
<!-- 
- 1 on 1 tensions w/ damian
- things dissolve when the EM is there
- Kickoff
    - eg: EM is there, I basically don't speak at all
- I go on a trip
    - trip coincidentally happens when some big session happens
    - used as further political leverage 
    - mentions of team change stuff. More blockers to moving teams
- The defensiveness of Damian
    - Eg: pulling out old feedback to say "not sudden, I was always saying this"
    - In what world is that kind of defensiveness useful?
    - Signs of political attack, not genuine feedback
-->

# Unbalanced Scales
<!--
- EM becomes frustrated (behind closed doors)
- Sides more with Damian
    - the document said "good engineer". It's fair feedback no?
- No opportunity to fight back now - no support from EM
    - Plus, how to raise? Nobody asked. No opportunity to rebutt convos in the background
    - Very one-sided convo as a result
- EM will not investigate situation further. Set in stone
- Eg: PR reviews, Damian claiming my work for theirs
- No amount of support from elsewhere will help
    - Despite support from all over org
    - Any consultation would fix issue. A second opinon from 
- EM still pushing for promo, but seemingly pushes harder for "feedback doc" 
    - Could see they were frustrated, but with me
        - Knew the way EM expressed themselves. Never directly. Very sugar coated
        - Eg: <refer to those notes from premortem exercise>
-->

# Porcelain Shards
<!-- 
- "Damian" loses it
- Unkind words used
    - Analyse them anyway
    - EM decides that after this chat, the issue is resolved??? Things hsould be better somehow???
- Burnout
    - How EM saw this as avoidance?? That "Damian" was doing a great job doing work, and I wasn't
    - Touch on how empathy doesn't work here. How as an EM can you see a situation like this and not want to speak to all parties, figure out what's actually happening, if a resolution came about?
        - Instead assuming things are fine and using more scapegoating
        - Perhaps this was with the influence of "Damian"
- Damian uses my work and gets credit for it
    - EM was very impressed with all the great work Damian was doing. How they were pushing on with the work
    - Yet it was all my work, from my plans... at best, Damian had it explained to them and gave some input on it
    - EM is frustrated with me now
        - Seen EG: where EM is reviewing PRs etc
- By this point my stamina was worn out
    - Dealing with all the pressure, anxiety alone
    - I hadn't given up. But it was fundamentally difficult to continue here
- Look after yourself
    - When you are alone especially. You need

## Pulling a Nerve
After a week's break during a week of public holidays, we return and see that our calendar is filled once again with meetings with Damian.

Things seem to be a little better for having had time away. Extremely tense still, but slightly less so now. 

One notable interaction happens during a call on this day: in a moment of candor during conversation, you say something to the effect of "the promotion is ruined, but that's ok - I can try again next round". The context of the conversation was something around reflecting on the recent events, that it's all water under the bridge.

This implication that Damian had "ruined" anything, or indeed done anything wrong at all in this situation seemed to sit poorly with them. They did not react immediately, but it was apparent that something had just clicked within them.

## All Pretenses Dropped
The air is still on the first scheduled meeting of the day with Damian. As soon as the call begins, things feel off. Moreso than they have the past few weeks.

There is no small talk to begin this meeting, and Damian joins the meeting with a particularly unhappy expression. Through clenched teeth, they begin to speak. Their first words are something to the effect of "we need to talk about your future as an engineer". 

The meeting begins tense, and only gets more tense as it goes on. Damian's voice dominates, and you notice that the structure of their sentences, and the curt "I am upset and here's why" tone that you first saw in their original "feedback" document to you is apparent in their speech. 

Lots is said - best described as a stream of concsciousness from Damian, as they air their grieveances about you. In this position, you remain composed and practice your active listening. Short leading sentences as responses when you have opportunity to speak, no questions or clarifications should be asked of Damian, and no attempt should be made to steer the conversation elsewhere. Damian wants to be heard, and right now listening is the only tactical play you have.

The content of the tirade was largely around "what it means to be a good engineer" and "what it takes to be a staff engineer". Pretty much Damian justifying why they feel you are a long way away from deserving promotion, amongst other "interesting" complaints about you as a person.

Things contibue to escalate in intensity. Around the 30 minute mark the topic of their original "feedback" document comes up, and you ask for feedback on how my implementation of their feedback has gone. The response was blunt: "I feel you have failed to make any progress at all on the feedback I have given you". [TODO - analysis of Damian's feelings of hurt / ego ].

Things become less and less coherent from here as things go on. Damian suddenly shifts to talking about their immensely troubled childhood, and all the difficulties they had to face to get to where they are. The specific details are... concerning, but also not relevant to our analysis. 

At the end of the meeting, Damian is at the peak of their agitation and now completely drops any semblence of civility, using strong ad hominem. You nod, and let them speak. 

Because you have not reacted with the same emotion to these words, Damian now runs out of things to say. They look into the camera, fidgeting and moving, still in a state of severe emotional compromise but completely unable to elicit an emotional response from you. The call ends abruptly as Damian leaves.

### Harsh Words

Let's analyse some of the words Damian used at the end of this incident. Of those used, three stood out in particular. It's obvious at this stage that there is no pretense of "providing constructive feedback". but nonetheless we may glean insights into the root of Damian's problem with you through them.

#### Pig-Headed

#### Stubborn

#### Disrespectful


## Catching Your Breath

Ok. That was rough. Easily right up there as one of the most uncomfortable interactions you've ever had in your career. However, leaving that call, you're feeling a little more hopeful about this ordeal than you had up til this point, and there are a couple of reasons why.

1. You handled it well. Despite the unkind words used against you, and the general.. outburst you've just endured, you did not retaliate, and you employed your conflict de-escalation skills very well

    - In a situation like this, where someone has become severely emotionally compromised, all you must do is practice active listening. The compromised individual wants to be heard

    - Special care is required, as even clarifying questions on things you're told can rapidly deteriorate the situation. You are neck-deep in the Kobayashi Maru now, your only goal is survival, and minimisation of damage

    - The end of the meeting is an indication that you have operated correctly. Damian has run out of things to say, and has failed to elicit an emotional response from you

2. Recall that earlier we talked about how the usual pitfall for emotionally insecure individuals [TODO - ensure linked back] is that they will typically blunder their position by very visibly having outbursts or employing ad hominem like this

    - We now have an unambiguous event we can use to escalate the situation, get the truth uncovered, and have our name cleared

    - Given the nature of what has happened, we should be able to get our EM to recognise the situation and escalate to HR

## Oh..

Amidst the ever growing stress and anxiety of the situation, you compose yourself the next day and prepare to chat with your EM. You've kept your cool and done everything you had to, this is your chance to finally reign in the situation.

Your EM listens, then responds. They signpost that they're listening to you, they see that you're clearly a little anxious and aim to calm you down a little first. Great idea - ok, let's take another breath and continue describing what we've just experienced.

They listen, and they understand what you're saying. Ok! Now we describe the worst part of it all - the ad hominem, and the sudden and unwanted insights we got into this individual's troubled childhood, the 40 minute tirade it came via.

Your EM listens, then responds again, they're listening to you, and they understand what you're saying. And- oh... 

The EM doesn't seem to see anything wrong, and has no intention of doing anything with this info... they are just validating you. "I understand you're still having trouble dealing with this feedback, let's chat more soon". They're still just frustrated that you're questioning anything at all, and not just actioning the "feedback". You are still the problem here, in their eyes.

...

Well, we've known for a while that this is a no-win situation. 

There seems to be little point in reaching out to HR at this stage - without managerial support, our chances of anything meaningful happening are slim to none. Not to mention that the thought of escalating "feels" wrong to you, given you're still in the mindset of [TODO - link to the cult mindset]



# Walking Out With the Laundry
<!-- 
- Checkin with Damian about feedback
    - "Frankly I see no improvement"
- New team
    - One I was thinking of heading to anyway, for a new challenge
    - EM I already knew, understood, and trusted
- concepts of cult
    - The way you need to be positive, no room for negativity
    - negativity is shut down immediately
    - Allude to "good vibes only" article draft concepts
- peacefully leave team, actually rough and painful
- feeling gaslit into seeming like you're the problem
    - spending a long time before being able to process and shake this feeling. 
    - eg: natural response if staff and EM give you feedback, tell you you're at fault, is to believe you're at fault
    - help with analysing the situation. understanding it 
- 
-->


# A Record, Scrubbed
<!-- 
- Watching achievements be erased
    - why the EM does this -> playing the game. decided I am bad touch
-  Rest of team did ask some Qs. But did not want to press the matter
    - I didn't blow up the issue either. Reassured team things were fine, I was moving onto a new challenge
    - Cult mindset. Don't rock the boat
-->


# Damage Control
<!-- 
- Reaching out to EM after some time has elapsed. 
    - Go into detail about the summary I got at that point
- Learning about everything that had happened in the background
- Realising the extent of the damage
- Shaking off the cult mindset / gaslighting
- Despite everything, still having to apologise.... again
    - Suggestion from strong mentory
    - Mention how this is trust in mentor. They see something that I do not
    - Either way, it buys a tempo. I earn their trust, that's all I care about. i don't see a particularly good outcome from this
    - Talk about hypothesis: response from Damian could be a thumbs up, a written ack, or an admission of guilt on their part
-->
 

# Epilogue
<!-- 
- Damian leaves
    - gambling online casino
- who knows where I'll end up
    - staff offers. could leave anytime
        - eg: make sure the control remains with you 
-->
## Where are they now
- "Damian" now works at an online casino

# Wrapping Up
 <!--
 - thank rexy, friends
    - mention help w/ neurospicy stuff
-->
## Summary
<!-- 
- We all likely have to face a Damian of our own at some point
- (summarise key findings + advice)
    - It's hard to recognise how important the other stuff is, in the moment. Other connections, mentorships, friends.

## Thanks
I want to thank my much more experienced friends for lending me their advice and braincells, and for pulling me to come step outside and live life whilst I was in the thick of things. I especially want to thank my good mate Rex for all the 3am minecraft sessions talking through this stuff, and Gex and Tim for the quality advice from the neurospicy-perspective.

A big shoutout goes to my old friend and then-fellow-EM who mentored me whilst I was finding my feet as a fresh engineering manager many years ago, whose career means he's not allowed to get a named shoutout. It's anonymity for you, bucko! 

This is the third or fourth rewrite of this blog post I've made in 6 months, and his recommendations on "Radical Candor" and "The Ladder of Interference" have given handles to concepts I was otherwise having trouble expressly concisely.

And hey, not to be cheesy, but thank you for reading!

## Please Provide me Your Braincells

Have you faced a situation like this yourself? Are there things I didn't touch on, or you think I should've done differently? Are there other tools and resources you can recommend for dealing with situations of this category?

This is also one of my first blog posts, so let me know how the layout and things are. I'm still yet to build up a [Soatok](https://soatok.blog/)-level of commissioned art to be able to use in these!

I would love to hear your thoughts down below.
